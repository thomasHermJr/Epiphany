# Epiphany

Epiphany is a personal project being created by Thomas Joseph Herm Jr. The primary purpose is to have a space
for general experimentation, and is not currently intended to be a showcase or portfolio piece.
It is being kept public for transparency, especially if it were to grow into something more significant.

More information about the project may be available at a later date.
